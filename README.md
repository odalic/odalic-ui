# Odalic User Interface

Odalic UI serves as a graphical user interface to the [Odalic Semantic Table Interpretation](https://github.com/odalic/sti) backend.

It is a web application allowing its users to extract and export Linked Data from provided CSV files. Backed by the Odalic STI, it features:
- Pleasant single-page user interface
- Interactive tables for easier feedback provision and transparent display of the results
- Interactive graph visualization of discovered relations within the table
- Easy-to-use controls for the files and tasks management and configuration.

The Odalic UI is the native supported GUI of Odalic Semantic Table Interpretation, and as such demonstrates almost all of its features, together providing a comprehensive platform to convert Open Data published in the form of CSV files to Linked Open Data, making them inherently more valuable, easier to query, integrate and share.
